DAY 1
Hello anyone who is reading this small message.

This is a website which I designed and coded myself for a bakey. 

The designing process took me two days while the resource collection and the code for the HOME page took me just one day.

This projects is not done yet. There are a few more pages which I will be adding to the project. 

Slowly I will be creating them all and publish them here on git.

So stay tuned.

DAY 2

I just finished the gallery. It wasn't that hard. Just using a grid and that was it.

Now I will start on the menu and the contact page.

They wil be done by tomorow.
